  <h1>Lab 4: Content</h1>
  <p>In the last lab we created a new site and theme.</p>
<p>Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the &ldquo;front matter,&rdquo; which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.</p>
<p>The following is an example file. The data enclosed in <code>---</code> is front matter. Everything below the front matter is the markdown content.</p>
<pre><code>---
title: This is an example
draft: true
date: 2020-07-01
---
This is markdown content
</code></pre><h2 id="front-matter">Front Matter</h2>
<p>The front matter is information about the content. It can be formatted in YAML, TOML, or JSON. We will be using YAML in these labs. For more information about other formats visit the <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">Hugo documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.</p>
<h3 id="predefined-variables">Predefined Variables</h3>
<p>There are predefined variables that can be used in the front matter and sometimes change the behaviour of Hugo. The most important ones are listed below, for a full list visit the <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/#front-matter-variables">Hugo documentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>date</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
the datetime assigned to this page.</p>
<p><strong>draft</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
if <code>true</code>, the content will not be rendered unless the <code>--buildDrafts</code> flag is passed to the hugo command.</p>
<p><strong>title</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
the title for the content.</p>
<p><strong>weight</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
used for ordering your content in lists. Lower weight gets higher precedence. So content with lower weight will come first.</p>
<h3 id="user-defined">User-Defined</h3>
<p>You can add fields to your front matter arbitrarily to meet your needs. These user-defined key-values are placed into a single <code>.Params</code> variable for use in your templates.</p>
<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
<p>Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.</p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>Create a new Markdown file (<code>.md</code>) in <code>./content/labs/</code> and add some front matter (e.g. a <code>title</code>) and content. You can use the Markdown files from this repository.</p>
<p>You can expand the solution below if you need help.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>mkdir content/labs
curl -o content/labs/01_quicktour.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/hugo-techlab/master/labs/01_quicktour.md
</code></pre><p>Now add the following front matter at the top of <code>content/labs/01_quicktour.md</code>:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: 1. Quicktour
---
</code></pre><p>If you want you can also add additional content.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You will notice that the content is not rendered by Hugo. In the next lab we will create a template that renders the Markdown into HTML.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hugo does not delete old files from <code>./public</code>. If you want a clean build, then delete it first.</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf public
hugo
ls -l public/labs
</code></pre><p>By default every section has an RSS output (see <code>index.xml</code>). But the HTML file is not generated, because there is no matching template in <code>./layouts</code>.</p>
